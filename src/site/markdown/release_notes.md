# Release Notes

All past Kite releases are documented on this page. Upcoming release dates can be found in
[JIRA](https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/CDK#selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project%3Aversions-panel).

## Version 0.17.0

Release date: 9 October 2014

Version 0.17.0 contains the following notable changes:

* The [Kite examples](https://github.com/kite-sdk/kite-examples) now require the
  [Cloudera Quickstart VM](http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/downloads/quickstart_vms/cdh-5-1-x1.html)
  version 5.1 or later.
* Kite 0.15.0 and 0.16.0 default to an appender which writes to both Avro and Parquet files, thus incurring
  2x the I/O resources,  when writing to a Parquet dataset. That default has switched back to the behavior
  from 0.14.0 and before which is to write just to Parquet. When using a Parquet dataset, the
  `DatasetWriter#flush()` and `DatasetWriter#sync()` methods have no effect. That means data written to
  a Parquet dataset is not durable until after a successful call to `DatasetWriter#close()`. Users that
  want the behavior found in 0.15.0 and 0.16.0 can set the property __`kite.parquet.non-durable-writes`__ to
  __`false`__ using the API or the
  [`update` command](http://kitesdk.org/docs/current/guide/Kite-Dataset-Command-Line-Interface/#update)
  in the CLI. After setting the property, the `DatasetWriter#flush()` and `DatasetWriter#sync()` methods
  will flush and sync the Avro version of the data respectively. If there is a failure before the writer
  is closed, the data can be recovered by reading the Avro version of the file and writing the records
  to Parquet. This recovery is a manual process.
* Kite now supports namespaces for datasets. For Hive datasets, the Kite namespace maps to the
  Hive database where the table will be stored. Namespaces also changed the file system repository
  layout for local file and HDFS datasets. Dataset URIs used with previous releases will work
  unmodified. New datasets created using the `DatasetRepository` API (which moved to the SPI in 0.16.0)
  will not end up in the same location as in previous releases. The work-around is to use dataset URIs
  with the `Datasets` API. See the docs on [dataset URIs](http://kitesdk.org/docs/current/guide/URIs/)
  for more details.
* Users can now select the compression codec for Avro and Parquet datasets. See
  [CDK-299](https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/CDK-299) for more details.
* The `kite-data-hcatalog` module has been renamed to `kite-data-hive`. A Maven relocation
  was put in place to prevent projects from breaking. However, we strongly encourage you to update
  your dependency to `kite-data-hive` in your projects. See [CDK-452](https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/CDK-452)
  for details.
* Hive external table URIs no long support relative locations. A URI with the pattern
  `dataset:hive:examples/ratings` now means to use a namespace of `examples` and a
  dataset named `ratings`. You can create external URIs using the `location` query paramter.
  For example: `dataset:hive:examples/ratings?location=/tmp/data/examples/ratings`.
* The Kite CLI tool has been renamed from `dataset` to `kite-dataset`. See
  [CDK-670](https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/CDK-670) for more information.
* Kite will no longer use an embedded MetaStore if it is not configured to
  connect to a remote MetaStore. Instead, Kite will throw an exception to avoid
  confusing behavior. See [CDK-651](https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/CDK-651)
  for more information.
* You can now partition datasets by sub-fields. See [CDK-435](https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/CDK-435)
  for details.
* Morphlines Library
    * Added morphline command that removes all record field values for which the field name and value matches a blacklist but not a whitelist: [removeValues](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#removeValues)

is available from JIRA.

## Version 0.16.0

Release date: 21 August 2014

Version 0.16.0 contains the following notable changes:

* Kite datasets can be read from and written to by Apache Spark jobs. See the new
[Spark example](https://github.com/kite-sdk/kite-examples/tree/master/spark) for details on usage.
* Added a CLI [transform task](https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/CDK-549) for transforming
entities read from a source dataset before storing then into a target dataset.
* Added a CDH5 application parent POM that makes it easy to build Kite applications on CDH5 using Maven.
The [Spark example](https://github.com/kite-sdk/kite-examples/tree/master/spark) uses this parent POM.
* The `DatasetRepository` and `DatasetRepositories` APIs have been moved to the SPI and
deprecated from the public API. Users should move to the new
[`Datasets`](http://kitesdk.org/docs/current/apidocs/org/kitesdk/data/Datasets.html) API before the
next release.
* Kite will now properly generate Parquet Hive tables on Hive 0.13 and later.
* Writing to a non-empty dataset or view from MapReduce or Crunch will now fail unless 
the write mode is explicitly set to append or overwrite. This is a change from 
the previous behavior which was to append. See
[CDK-572](https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/CDK-572) and
[CDK-347](https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/CDK-347) for details.

* Deprecated partition related methods in [Dataset](http://kitesdk.org/docs/current/apidocs/org/kitesdk/data/Dataset.html) in favor of the views API.
* Added a CLI [copy task](https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/CDK-374) for copying 
datasets and also for dataset format conversion and data compaction.
* Added an application parent POM that makes it easy to use Kite in a Maven project. 
The [examples](https://github.com/kite-sdk/kite-examples) now use this parent POM.
* Updated to Crunch 0.10.0
* Morphlines Library
    * Added morphline command that parses an InputStream that contains protobuf data: [readProtobuf](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#readProtobuf) (Rober Fiser via whoschek)
    * Added morphline command that extracts specific values from a protobuf object, akin to a simple form of XPath: [extractProtobufPaths](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#extractProtobufPaths) (Rober Fiser via whoschek)
    * Added morphline command that removes all record fields for which the field name matches a blacklist but not a whitelist: [removeFields](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#removeFields)
    * Added optional parameters `maxCharactersPerRecord` and `onMaxCharactersPerRecord` to morphline command [readCSV](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#readCSV)

## Version 0.10.0

Release date: December 9, 2013

Version 0.10.0 has the following notable changes:

* Renamed the project from CDK to Kite.
  The main goal of Kite is to increase the accessibility of Apache Hadoop as a platform. 
  This isn't specific to Cloudera, so we updated the name to correctly represent the project as an open, community-driven set of tools.
  To make migration easier, there are no **feature changes** and [migration instructions](migrating.html) have been added for existing projects.
    * Renamed java packages `com.cloudera.cdk.*` to `org.kitesdk.*`. This change is trivial and mechanical but it does break backwards compatibility. This is a one-time event - going forward no such backwards incompatible renames are planned. This mass rename is the only change going from the `cdk-0.9.0` release to the `kite-0.10.0` release.
    * Renamed maven module names and jar files from `cdk-*` to `kite-*`.
    * Moved github repo from http://github.com/cloudera/cdk to http://github.com/kite-sdk/kite.
    * Moved documentation from http://cloudera.github.io/cdk/docs/current to http://kitesdk.org/docs/current.
    * Moved morphline reference guide from http://cloudera.github.io/cdk/docs/current/cdk-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html to http://kitesdk.org/docs/current/kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html.

## Version 0.9.0

Release date: December 5, 2013

Version 0.9.0 has the following notable changes:

* HBase support. There is a new experimental API working with random access datasets
  stored in HBase. The API exposes get/put operations, but there is no support for
  scans from an arbitrary row in this release. (The latter will be added in 0.11.0 as a
  part of the forthcoming [views API](https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/CDK-177).) For
  usage information, consult the new
  [HBase example](https://github.com/cloudera/cdk-examples/tree/master/dataset-hbase).
* Parquet. Datasets in Parquet format can now be written (and read) using Crunch.
* CSV. Datasets in CSV format can now be read using the dataset APIs. See the
  [compatibility example](https://github.com/cloudera/cdk-examples/tree/master/dataset-compatibility).
* Dataset API. Removed APIs that were deprecated in 0.8.0. See the
  [API Diffs](http://cloudera.github.io/cdk/docs/0.9.0/jdiff/changes.html) for all the
  changes.
* Morphlines Library
    * Added morphline command to read from RCFile: [readRCFile](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#readRCFile) (Prasanna Rajaperumal via whoschek)
    * Added morphline command to convert a morphline record to an Avro record: [toAvro](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#toAvro)
    * Added morphline command that serializes Avro records into a byte array: [writeAvroToByteArray](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#writeAvroToByteArray)
    * Added morphline command that returns Geolocation information for a given IP address, using an efficient in-memory Maxmind database lookup:
      [geoIP](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#geoIP)
    * Added morphline command that parses a user agent string and returns structured higher level data like user agent family, operating system, version, and device type:
      [userAgent](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#userAgent)
    * Added option to fail the following commands if an URI is syntactically invalid:
      [extractURIComponents](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#extractURIComponents),
      [extractURIComponent](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#extractURIComponent),
      [extractURIQueryParameters](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#extractURIQueryParameters)
    * Upgraded cdk-morphlines-solr-core module from solr-4.4 to solr-4.6.
    * Upgraded cdk-morphlines-saxon module from saxon-HE-9.5.1-2 to saxon-HE-9.5.1-3.
    * Fixed race condition on parallel initialization of multiple Solr morphlines within the same JVM.
    * For enhanced safety readSequenceFile command nomore reuses the identity of Hadoop Writeable objects.

    * Made xquery and xslt commands also compatible with woodstox-3.2.7 (not just woodstox-4.x).

## Version 0.8.0

Release date: October 7, 2013

Version 0.8.0 has the following notable changes:

* Dataset Repository URIs. Repositories can be referred to (and opened) by a URI. For
  example, repo:hdfs://namenode:8020/data specifies a Dataset Repository stored in HDFS.
  Dataset descriptors carry the repository URI.
* Dataset API. Removed APIs that were deprecated in 0.7.0. Deprecated some constructors
  in favor of builders. See [API Diffs](http://cloudera.github.io/cdk/docs/0.8.0/jdiff/changes.html)
  for all the changes.
* Upgrade to Parquet 1.2.0.
* Morphlines Library
    * Added option for commands to register health checks (not just metrics) with the MorphlineContext.
    * Added [registerJVMMetrics](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#registerJVMMetrics) command that registers metrics that are related to the Java Virtual Machine
      with the MorphlineContext. For example, this includes metrics for garbage collection events,
      buffer pools, threads and thread deadlocks.
    * Added morphline commands to publish the metrics of all morphline commands to JMX, SLF4J and CSV files.
      The new commands are:
      [startReportingMetricsToJMX](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#startReportingMetricsToJMX),
      [startReportingMetricsToSLF4](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#startReportingMetricsToSLF4J) and
      [startReportingMetricsToCSV](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#startReportingMetricsToCSV).
    * Added EXPERIMENTAL `cdk-morphlines-metrics-servlets` maven module with new
      [startReportingMetricsToHTTP](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#startReportingMetricsToHTTP) command that
      exposes liveness status, health check status, metrics state and thread dumps via a set of HTTP URIs served by Jetty,
      using the AdminServlet.
    * Added `cdk-morphlines-hadoop-core` maven module with new
      [downloadHdfsFile](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#downloadHdfsFile)
      command for transferring HDFS files, e.g. to help with centralized configuration file management.
    * Added option to specify boost values to
      [loadSolr](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#loadSolr) command.
    * Added several performance enhancements.
    * Upgraded `cdk-morphlines-solr-cell` maven module from tika-1.3 to tika-1.4 to pick up some bug fixes.
    * Upgraded `cdk-morphlines-core` maven module from com.google.code.regexp-0.1.9 to 0.2.3 to pick up some bug fixes (Internally shaded version).
    * The constructor of AbstractCommand now has an additional parameter that refers to the CommandBuilder.
      The old constructor has been deprecated and will be removed in the next release.
    * The ISO8601_TIMEZONE grok pattern now allows the omission of minutes in a timezone offset.
    * Ensured morphline commands can refer to record field names containing arbitrary characters.
      Previously some commands could not refer to record field names containing the '.' dot character.
      This limitation has been removed.
