# Release Notes

All past Kite releases are documented on this page. Upcoming release dates can be found in
[JIRA](https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/CDK#selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project%3Aversions-panel).

## Version 0.12.0

Release date: TBD

Version 0.12.0 has the following notable changes:

* Views API. There is an incompatible change in this release: RefineableView in the
  org.kitesdk.data package has been renamed to RefinableView (no 'e'). Clients should
  update and recompile.

    * Added a sampling command that forwards each input record with a given probability to its child command: [sample](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#sample)
    * Added a command that ignores all input records beyond the N-th record, akin to the Unix head command: [head](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#head)
    * Improved morphline import performance if all commands are specified via fully qualified class names.
    * Added several performance enhancements.
    * Added an [example module](https://github.com/kite-sdk/kite-examples/tree/master/kite-examples-morphlines) that describes how to unit test Morphline config files and custom Morphline commands.
    * Improved documentation.

## Version 0.11.0

Release date: February 6, 2014

Version 0.11.0 has the following notable changes:

is available from JIRA.

## Version 0.10.0

Release date: December 9, 2013

Version 0.10.0 has the following notable changes:

* Renamed the project from CDK to Kite.
  The main goal of Kite is to increase the accessibility of Apache Hadoop as a platform. 
  This isn't specific to Cloudera, so we updated the name to correctly represent the project as an open, community-driven set of tools.
  To make migration easier, there are no **feature changes** and [migration instructions](migrating.html) have been added for existing projects.
    * Renamed java packages `com.cloudera.cdk.*` to `org.kitesdk.*`. This change is trivial and mechanical but it does break backwards compatibility. This is a one-time event - going forward no such backwards incompatible renames are planned. This mass rename is the only change going from the `cdk-0.9.0` release to the `kite-0.10.0` release.
    * Renamed maven module names and jar files from `cdk-*` to `kite-*`.
    * Moved github repo from http://github.com/cloudera/cdk to http://github.com/kite-sdk/kite.
    * Moved documentation from http://cloudera.github.io/cdk/docs/current to http://kitesdk.org/docs/current.
    * Moved morphline reference guide from http://cloudera.github.io/cdk/docs/current/cdk-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html to http://kitesdk.org/docs/current/kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html.

## Version 0.9.0

Release date: December 5, 2013

Version 0.9.0 has the following notable changes:

* HBase support. There is a new experimental API working with random access datasets
  stored in HBase. The API exposes get/put operations, but there is no support for
  scans from an arbitrary row in this release. (The latter will be added in 0.11.0 as a
  part of the forthcoming [views API](https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/CDK-177).) For
  usage information, consult the new
  [HBase example](https://github.com/cloudera/cdk-examples/tree/master/dataset-hbase).
* Parquet. Datasets in Parquet format can now be written (and read) using Crunch.
* CSV. Datasets in CSV format can now be read using the dataset APIs. See the
  [compatibility example](https://github.com/cloudera/cdk-examples/tree/master/dataset-compatibility).
* Dataset API. Removed APIs that were deprecated in 0.8.0. See the
  [API Diffs](http://cloudera.github.io/cdk/docs/0.9.0/jdiff/changes.html) for all the
  changes.
* Morphlines Library
    * Added morphline command to read from RCFile: [readRCFile](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#readRCFile) (Prasanna Rajaperumal via whoschek)
    * Added morphline command to convert a morphline record to an Avro record: [toAvro](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#toAvro)
    * Added morphline command that serializes Avro records into a byte array: [writeAvroToByteArray](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#writeAvroToByteArray)
    * Added morphline command that returns Geolocation information for a given IP address, using an efficient in-memory Maxmind database lookup:
      [geoIP](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#geoIP)
    * Added morphline command that parses a user agent string and returns structured higher level data like user agent family, operating system, version, and device type:
      [userAgent](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#userAgent)
    * Added option to fail the following commands if an URI is syntactically invalid:
      [extractURIComponents](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#extractURIComponents),
      [extractURIComponent](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#extractURIComponent),
      [extractURIQueryParameters](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#extractURIQueryParameters)
    * Upgraded cdk-morphlines-solr-core module from solr-4.4 to solr-4.6.
    * Upgraded cdk-morphlines-saxon module from saxon-HE-9.5.1-2 to saxon-HE-9.5.1-3.
    * Fixed race condition on parallel initialization of multiple Solr morphlines within the same JVM.
    * For enhanced safety readSequenceFile command nomore reuses the identity of Hadoop Writeable objects.

## Version 0.8.0

Release date: October 7, 2013

Version 0.8.0 has the following notable changes:

* Dataset Repository URIs. Repositories can be referred to (and opened) by a URI. For
  example, repo:hdfs://namenode:8020/data specifies a Dataset Repository stored in HDFS.
  Dataset descriptors carry the repository URI.
* Dataset API. Removed APIs that were deprecated in 0.7.0. Deprecated some constructors
  in favor of builders. See [API Diffs](http://cloudera.github.io/cdk/docs/0.8.0/jdiff/changes.html)

    * Added [registerJVMMetrics](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#registerJVMMetrics) command that registers metrics that are related to the Java Virtual Machine
      with the MorphlineContext. For example, this includes metrics for garbage collection events,
      buffer pools, threads and thread deadlocks.
    * Added morphline commands to publish the metrics of all morphline commands to JMX, SLF4J and CSV files.
      The new commands are:
      [startReportingMetricsToJMX](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#startReportingMetricsToJMX),
      [startReportingMetricsToSLF4](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#startReportingMetricsToSLF4J) and
      [startReportingMetricsToCSV](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#startReportingMetricsToCSV).
    * Added EXPERIMENTAL `cdk-morphlines-metrics-servlets` maven module with new
      [startReportingMetricsToHTTP](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#startReportingMetricsToHTTP) command that
      exposes liveness status, health check status, metrics state and thread dumps via a set of HTTP URIs served by Jetty,
      using the AdminServlet.
    * Added `cdk-morphlines-hadoop-core` maven module with new
      [downloadHdfsFile](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#downloadHdfsFile)
      command for transferring HDFS files, e.g. to help with centralized configuration file management.
    * Added option to specify boost values to
      [loadSolr](kite-morphlines/morphlinesReferenceGuide.html#loadSolr) command.
    * Added several performance enhancements.

    * The constructor of AbstractCommand now has an additional parameter that refers to the CommandBuilder.
      The old constructor has been deprecated and will be removed in the next release.
    * The ISO8601_TIMEZONE grok pattern now allows the omission of minutes in a timezone offset.
    * Ensured morphline commands can refer to record field names containing arbitrary characters.
