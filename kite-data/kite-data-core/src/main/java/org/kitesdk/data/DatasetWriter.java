/**
 * <p>
 * A stream-oriented dataset writer.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface write data to a {@link Dataset}.
 * Writers are use-once objects that serialize entities of type {@code E} and
 * write them to the underlying storage system. Normally, you are
 * not expected to instantiate implementations directly. Instead, use the
 * containing dataset's {@link Dataset#newWriter()} method to get an appropriate
 * implementation. You should receive an instance of this interface from a
 * dataset, invoke {@link #write(Object)} and {@link #flush()} as necessary,
 * and {@link #close()} when they are done, or no more data exists.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementations can hold system resources until the {@link #close()} method
 * is called, so you <strong>must</strong> follow the normal try / finally
 * pattern to ensure these resources are properly freed when the writer is no
 * longer needed. Do not rely on implementations automatically invoking the
 * {@code close()} method upon object finalization (implementations must not do
 * so). All implementations must silently ignore multiple invocations of
 * {@code close()} as well as a close of an unopened writer.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If any method throws an exception, the writer is no longer valid, and the
 * only method that can be subsequently called is {@code close()}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementations of {@link DatasetWriter} are typically not thread-safe; that
 * is, the behavior when accessing a single instance from multiple threads is
 * undefined.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <E> The type of entity accepted by this writer.
